            \vspace{0.2cm}
            I plan to investigate Machine Learning by developing a survival simulation environment 
            in which a character will be controlled by a Machine Learning algorithm. The survival simulation will 
            present multiple challenges such as dynamic threats towards the agent in order to provide a complex 
            problem for it to solve. The key question I aim to answer with this investigation is:

            \vspace{0.3cm}

            \begin{center}
            \textbf{Can you train a Machine Learning algorithm to survive in a pseudo random, open-world environment?}
            \end{center}

            \vspace{0.3cm}

            I find this question to be quite interesting because there is multiple layers of complexity to it, 
            with several different problems to solve. Answering the question will require me to dive headfirst into 
            Machine Learning picking things up as fast as possible.

        \item {\Large Background} \\
            \vspace{0.2cm}
            I am investigating this area of Computer Science because I've been interesting in attempting a form of
            Machine Learning for a while now but havent had a reason to dive into it. Machine Learning is an evolving
            field, with mere infinite applications such as Image Recognition, Chat Bots, Self Driving Cars, 
            etc. I feel as though my project will be sufficiently advanced enough to expand my knowledge of the subject.
            It will require lots of research, planning, and design work in order to successfully fulfil my Technical
            Solution. \\

        \item {\Large Expert} \\
            \vspace{0.2cm}
            For my expert I approached one of my friends, Ben, who has prior experience with Machine Learning. He has
            created his own Hand Written Digit Recognition Network before, along with using Python Libraries such as 
            \textit{PyTorch} to train an agent to play the game \textit{Flappy Bird}, among other ML projects. He has 
            a much better understanding of Machine Learning than me currently, so hopefully he will be a good resource 
            as I develop my project. \\
            \vspace{0.2cm}
            He has agreed to answer some questions for my Interview once I have completed my Initial Investigation.

                        \item {\large \textbf{Crafter}}
                            In my research on the Internet I discovered a project called $Crafter$.
                            
                            \centerline{\texit{https://github.com/danijar/crafter}}

                            Crafter is described to be \textit{"Benchmarking the Spectrum of Agent Capabilities"}, and is utlised
                            in conjunction with Machine Learning Algoriths such as $DreamerV2$, $PPO$ and $Rainbow$. Crafter poses significant
                            challenge towards its Player, requiring high levels of generalisation, long-term reasoning, and complex 
                            problem solving. If the machine Learning algorithm in question fails to achieve one of these aspects it will 
                            struggle to full "Solve" the simulation. \\

                            \vspace{0.2cm}

                            High levels of generalisation are required when training a Machine Learning algorithm, if this is not achieved then
                            your network will only lend itself to a single Dataset/Problem. An example of this would be training a network used
                            to recognise hand written digits on only one way of writing 4's, if presented with an input for a different type of 
                            4 it may not recognise it and identify it incorrectly. \\
                            
                            \vspace{0.2cm}

                            Long-Term reasoning is a complex problem to solve in the context of Machine Learning, current Machine Learning models
                            struggle to deal with this problem. This is dealt with by using algorithms built to mimic "memory". A common 
                            implementation of this is Experience Replay which stores states in a queue, and relearns from it after every N ammount
                            of steps. \\

                            \vspace{0.2cm}

                            A complex reward and action system may take time for an algorithm to learn but it certainly is possible with current
                            Machine Learning Models. Crafter utilises a complex action system with a flow chart determining which Action can be taken
                            given the current state of the simulation. Below is shown the Complex Flow Chart of Actions: \\

                            \vspace{0.2cm}
                            \begin{center}
                                \includegraphics[width=8cm]{Images/Initial Research/CrafterComplexActionSystem.PNG}
                                Complex action system as shown in the Paper "Benchmarking the Spectrum of Agent Capabilities" \\

                            \vspace{0.2cm}

                            While I would love to create a simulation similar to crafter, it is very complex and would take a long time to develop. Yet
                            would not net many marks in the process.

                            Minecraft is a \textit{very} popular Game. It's a sandbox game, meaning that the player can do almost anything they want.
                            It has infinite terrain generation, and explicity uses Perlin Noise, and is generated from a seed. The seed determines
                            all the terrain generation, loot tables, random structures, caves, etc. Two seeds next to eachother will also be wildly
                            different. \\

                            First it starts off on a very broad level, painting a basic topographical map of the world. It then adds finer detail
                            of noise in the form of Biomes, Shrubbery and Generated Structures. \\

                    {\Large Neural Network and Matrices} \\
                    As part of developing a Machine Learning Algorithm, I will need to implement a Matrix class in order to
                    implement a neural network. Matrices are commonly used to represent individual layers of a network. Along
                    with making calculations much easier, condensing them into performing operations on matrices, rather than
                    nested using nested for loops and lists. As part of my Initial Research I have taken the time to understand
                    how a Neural Network functions, it turns out I have already learned most of the Maths needed to understand
                    how it works in my A Level Maths and Further Maths courses. \\
                    \vspace{0.2cm}
                    A Neural Network functions as a series mathematical equations used to recognise relationships between inputs
                    and desired outputs. They take in a Vector of Input Data, and output a Vector of Output Data. They can be
                    in simple terms as a function: $N(x)$ where: $\{x \in V, N(x) \in V\}$. The functions name in this case is
                    Forward Propagation. 
                    \vspace{0.2cm}
                    We form a Neural Network with multiple layers of Nodes, the layers being referred to as the Input Layer, 
                    Hidden Layer/s and Output Layer. In this case each Node is connected to every Node in the previous layer and
                    the following layer. In the below image is represented a Neural Network with a layer structure of $[3, 5, 2]$.

                    Each connection, otherwise known as an Arc or Edge, has an associated weight. Along with every output of a
                    layer having an associated Bias. These are used to compute the outcome of a network.
                    \vspace{0.2cm}
                    Forward Propagation is used to compute the outcome of a network, it has a general form and uses 
                    Matrix Multiplication and Addition to achieve this.

                    For my project I am going to have to procedurally generate 2d terrain, while researching this I came across a few algorithms
                    which seemed to be able to do this pretty well. I will compare two algorithms I discovered below.

                            I discovered two post processing algorithms often used for simple 2d terrain generation. 1 Averages squares 
                            around the selected square, and the other pulls it up or down the gradient its currently on.
                            I find these interesting because they're relatively simple, and I'm not quite sure whether they will produce good results or not. 
                            \vspace{0.2cm}\linebreak
                            So it would be interesting to test out implementing these in my prototype.
                            &
                            Perlin Noise is an algorithm developed by Ken Perlin for use in the digital generation of noise.
                            This noise can be combined to create \textit{realistic} looking height maps for world generation.
                            Perlin Noise retains continuity and is seeded so the generation can be entirely controlled.
                            By "retains continuity" I mean that you can sample the same point and retrieve the same value.

                            If I was to implement Perlin noise it would take longer, but also might end up with a better result
                            due to it being more widely used. It's a trade-off between time to implement and desired result. \\

                    I also discovered an algorithm called Poisson Disc Sampling, this can be used to sample random points 
                    in N dimensional space. It takes in 2 values, the R and K value, these values determine the output of
                    the function. The R values is the minimum distance a point has to be from another, randomly placed point
                    which hasn't been selected yet. If the distance between any existing points is less than R, the point
                    will be rejected and another will be selected. The K value determines how many rejected are needed before 
                    the algorithm will stop attempting to choose a new point.

                    Below I have weighed up 3 options for Programming Language, along with 2 graphical libraries per language

            Before starting my Prototype I had to decide upon a short list of objectives I wanted to 
            complete/investigate as part of it. These boiled down to a few things:

            \vspace{0.2cm}
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Terrain Generation
                \item Displaying the Generated Terrain using a Graphics Library
                \item Matrix and Vector implementation
            \end{enumerate}
            \vspace{0.2cm}

            For my Prototype, I first created a GitHub Repository, available here: 
            
            \vspace{0.1cm}
            \centerline{\textit{https://github.com/TheTacBanana/CompSciNEAPrototype}}
            \vspace{0.1cm}

            I had created a hierarchy of importance for development in my head, visualized using this flow diagram:

                \end{tikzpicture}
            \end{center}

            I decided to use Python for developing my Prototype, this seemed like a good fit due to me 
            having lots of experience with the language. Python is a Dynamically Typed and Interpretted 
            language which makes it versatile for protyping and fast, iterative development.
            
            \vspace{0.5cm}

            {\Large Terrain Generation and Displaying} \\
            \vspace{0.25cm}

            Starting from the begining of my hierarchy I installed Pygame using \textit{pip} and started creating a window.
            This was a relatively simple task only taking a few lines:
            \vspace{0.5cm}

            \normalsize
            \begin{minted}[frame=leftline,framesep=2mm,baselinestretch=1.2,fontsize=\footnotesize,linenos]{python}
import pygame

simSize = 128
gridSize = 2

window = pygame.display.set_mode((simSize*gridSize, simSize*gridSize))
pygame.display.set_caption("Procedural Generation")

running = True
while running == True:
  for event in pygame.event.get():
    if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
      running = False
            \end{minted}

            \vspace{0.5cm}

            \large
            This creates a window like this: \\ 
            \vspace{0.5cm}
            \centerline{\includegraphics{Images/Prototype/CreateWindowExample.PNG}}

            \vspace{0.5cm}

            Following the hierarchy I then added noise generation by generating random numbers and 
            assigning them to a 2d List. Shown here: 
            
            \begin{minted}[frame=leftline,framesep=2mm,baselinestretch=1.2,fontsize=\footnotesize,linenos]{python}
def GenerateMap(self, seed):
    random.seed(seed)
    for y in range(0, self.arraySize):
        for x in range(0, self.arraySize):
            self.heightArray[x][y] = round(random.random(),2)
            \end{minted}

            \vspace{0.5cm}

            \large
            After creating some code to draw squares based upon the random value, I ended up with this 
            random array of Black-White squares:\\
            \vspace{0.5cm}
            \centerline{\includegraphics{Images/Prototype/RandomNoiseExample.PNG}}

            \vspace{0.5cm}

            This was a good start, but didnt really look like terrain yet. As part of my research I came 
            across simple algorithms to turn random noise into usable 2d terrain. I decided to implement
            these algorithms. They are relatively short and didnt take too much time to implement. I've
            named the two algorithms UpDownNeutralGen and Average.

            \vspace{1cm}

            {\large UpDownNeutralGen Method} \\
            \vspace{0.25cm}

            The UpDownNeutralGen method takes a tile, and considers every tile around it. It sums the tile 
            which are greater than, less than, or within a certain range of the tile height. And then pulls
            the selected tile in the direction which has the highest precedence. As an example, here are some
            randomly generated values:

            \begin{center}
                \begin{tabular}{| C{0.75cm} | C{0.75cm} | C{0.75cm} |}
                    \hline
                    0.71 & 0.19 & 0.3 \\ [0.75cm]
                    \hline
                    0.46 & 0.26 & 0.82 \\ [0.75cm]
                    \hline
                    0.63 & 0.35 & 0.05 \\ [0.75cm]
                    \hline
                \end{tabular}
            \end{center}

            If we count the surrounding values into corresponding Higher, Lower and Neutral we get: \\

            \begin{center}
                \begin{tabular}{| M{2cm} | M{2cm} | M{2cm} |}
                    \hline
                    Higher & Lower & Neutral \\ [0.25cm]
                    \hline
                    4 & 1 & 3 \\ [0.25cm]
                    \hline
                \end{tabular}
            \end{center}

            \vspace{0.5cm}

            This leads us to calculating the \textit{pullValue}, respectively for each case:
            \begin{center}
                $Up -> pullValue = upTiles * 0.09$ \\
                $Down -> pullValue = upTiles * -0.08$ \\
                $Neutral -> pullValue = 0$ \\
                \vspace{0.5cm}
                $Value[x][y] \pluseq pullValue$\\
            \end{center}
            
            \vspace{0.5cm}

            We then add the pullValue to the original square value, leaving us with the updated value. The code for 
            this shown under the Prototype Code Header.
            \vspace{0.5cm}

            {\large Average Method}
            \vspace{0.25cm}

            The Average method takes a tile and considers every tile around it, this time instead of looking at the
            differences, it creates an average from the 8 surrounding tiles. It then sets the selected tile to this
            average value. As an example, here are some randomly generated values:

            \begin{center}
                \begin{tabular}{| C{0.75cm} | C{0.75cm} | C{0.75cm} |}
                    \hline
                    0.83 & 0.93 & 0.64 \\ [0.75cm]
                    \hline
                    0.07 & 0.38 & 0.21 \\ [0.75cm]
                    \hline
                    0.33 & 0.94 & 0.95 \\ [0.75cm]
                    \hline
                \end{tabular}
                \vspace{0.25cm}

                Summing these and dividing by the total grants us the average:

                \[
                \frac{0.83 + 0.93 + 0.64 + 0.07 + 0.38 + 0.21 + 0.95 + 0.33 + 0.94}{9} = 0.586
                \]
                $Value[x][y] = 0.586$
            \end{center}
            \vspace{0.25cm}

            The code for this shown under the Prototype Code Header.

            \vspace{1cm}

            {\large Finished Terrain Generation} \\
            \vspace{0.25cm}

            Overall I am happy with the Terrain generation, though I feel as if it could be improved to look more realistic.
            The difference between the original random noise and the Colour Mapped Terrain looks so much better.

            {\Large Matrix Data Structure} \\
            \vspace{0.25cm}

            As part of my Matrix Class I made a list of operations which would be key to a Matrix Class, along with being useful
            for Machine Learning. A Matrix is an abstract data type, commonly used in Maths, but has practical uses in the world
            of Computer Science. It holds a 2d array of values such as: \\ 
            \begin{center}
            $\begin{pmatrix}
                a & b\\
                c & d
            \end{pmatrix}$ 
            $\begin{pmatrix}
                a & b & c \\
                d & e & f \\
                g & h & i 
            \end{pmatrix}$ 
            $\begin{pmatrix}
                a \\
                b \\
                c  
            \end{pmatrix}$ 
            $\begin{pmatrix}
                a & b & c & d\\
                e & f & g & h
            \end{pmatrix}$ 
            \end{center}
            The values in a Matrix can be manipulated using common operations such as $+ - *$ as long as the orders of the 2 Matrices
            match up. Along with other, non-standard operations which have other purposes.

            \vspace{0.25cm}
            As part of my Matrix Class, I implemented the following operators:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Addition/Subtraction \\
                    Implementing Addition didnt take too long, I utilised a nested for loop to iterate over every value in both Matrices.
                    Adding the two values together into a temporary Matrix which the method then returned. 
                    \vspace{0.25cm}

                        $\begin{pmatrix}

                            c & d
                        \end{pmatrix} +
                        \begin{pmatrix}
                            e & f\\
                            g & h
                        \end{pmatrix} =
                        \begin{pmatrix}
                            a+e & b+f\\
                            c+g & d+h
                        \end{pmatrix}$

                \item Multiplication \\
                    Multiplication of Matrices is slightly more complicated, it is of $O(n^3)$ complexity, utilising a triple nested for loop.
                    It multiplies the row of a $M1$, by the column in $M2$. Summing the calculation into the element in the new Matrix $M3$. \\

                \item Determinant \\
                    Calculating the Determinant of an NxN Matrix is a recursive algorithm. With the base case being the Determinant of a 2x2
                    Matrix. When calculating the Determinant of a 3x3 Matrix you create a Matrix of Cofactors, and multiply each 
                    value by the corresponding value in the Sin Matrix (\textit{Formed from repeating 1's and -1's}). Summing the values from
                    a singular Row or Column will then give you the Determinant. For a 4x4 you simply calculate the Determinant of the corresponding
                    3x3's to get the Cofactors.

            {\Large Prototype Evaluation} \\
            \vspace{0.25cm}

            Overall I am happy with my prototype, though I feel like some parts need to be improved. I did meet my 
            objectives for my prototype but there were improvements which can me made when I create my Technical Solution. 
            Namely the Terrain Generation along with the Matrix class. I feel that Perlin noise would be a better alternative
            to the two algorithms I used. In theory it should produce better results, and also provice more marks for 
            complexity. My Matrix class could be rewritten to be more efficient, along with using operator overloading, which
            I didnt know Python could do at the time. I also feel like having vector inherit from matrix is relatively pointless,
            there is no need for it when I could just use 1 wide Matrices.
