        I plan to investigate Machine Learning by developing a survival simulation environment in which an Agent will be controlled by a Machine Learning algorithm. The survival simulation will present multiple challenges towards the agent in order to provide a complex problem for it to solve. The key question I aim to answer with this investigation is:
